          An interview does not commit you to participate in a photoshoot.
          During our initial interview, we will establish our mutual
          expectations. I will also gather your contact information, emergency
          contact information and information about your physical limitations,
          if any, your food and insect allergies and picnic food preferences and
          your favorite cereal. We will agree on your hourly fees for travel
          time and for modeling time. I will advise you of my planed photoshoot
          location and we will agree on place and time to meet, subject to
          weather, and the clothing and props you will be expected to provide,
          if any. Even if you agree to a photoshoot at the end of the interview,
          you may cancel up to the day before the planned shoot date.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the photoshoot, you should have normal gear for a light day hike,
          including footwear, rain jacket, sunscreen (“dry touch” – non greasy)
          and hat or cap. I will have mirror, but you will want to carry a comb
          or brush. You are encouraged to carry your cell phone in case of
          emergency.
        </p>
        <p>
          You should have a loose fitting coverup (which could double for
          travel) and sandals or slip-on shoes to wear while walking about the
          site between photos. Your hair should be freshly washed and normally
          styled, makeup should be “everyday”, legs and underarms shaved; and,
          pubic hair, if usually trimmed, shaved or waxed, should be recently
          treated. Because of the lingering impression elastic bands have on
          skin, you should not wear undergarments with elastic bands while
          traveling to the shoot location, even if you do not at the outset
          intend to model fully nude.
        </p>
        <p>
          DAY HIKING AND RELATED TRAVEL POSE RISKS TO PERSONAL SAFETY: You will
          be asked to acknowledge and to confirm that you understand day hiking
          and related travel may result in hiking injuries, such as
          scratches/cuts, sprains, breaks, falls, bruising, insect bites,
          snakebite and other injuries and travel and related injuries. You will
          be asked to agree that you are entirely responsible for your own
          personal safety and to understand you may decline any suggested trail
          or any suggested spot for photos. You will be asked to confirm that
          you understand you should express concern for your personal safety at
          any time. You will be asked to agree that I have no responsibility or
          liability to you for any injuries you may sustain in travel to and
          from and in the course of the photo shoot and no liability for any
          costs for medical treatment. And, you will be asked to generally and
          specifically release me from responsibility and liability for
          injuries.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will be asked to sign a general <a href="../ModelInformation/ModelRelease.html">Model Release</a> at the end of the
          photoshoot. The general Model Release does not cover images in which
          you are identifiable by face, hairstyle (if distinctive), tattoos and
          piercings by friends and family. If I should wish to use any such
          images on my website, I will ask you for an addendum to the Model
          Release to cover specific images after you have had an opportunity to
          review the images. You may decline to release any images in which you
          are identifiable by friends and family. No images, whether you are
          identifiable or not identifiable (even with your approval) will ever
          be used on any social media.

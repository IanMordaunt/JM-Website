          WILL THIS BE YOUR FIRST EXPERIENCE MODELING LESS THAN FULLY CLOTHED?

          Your decision to model partially clothed, partially nude or fully nude
          for the first time is an important one. Even your consideration of
          modeling or commitment to model partially clothed or in any state of
          nudity can present an emotional hurdle. The experience of modeling
          partially clothed or in any state of nudity for the first time may put
          you outside your comfort zone and may be emotionally challenging.
          Although you may experience anxiety about and anticipate feeling
          vulnerable, you can be assured I will seek to keep you in a perfectly
          safe environment. At some point early in the photoshoot, you may
          expect to forget about your lack of clothing and begin to get involved
          in how your pose will fit into the natural landscape features – the
          trees and rocks. As will be noted in my interview presentation, my
          objective is for you to have an enjoyable experience, one I hope you
          will be eager to repeat.
        </p>
        <p>
          I prefer to use amateur models because they do not have a repertoire
          of stock poses. This is the reason I have approached you about
          modeling. As a consequence, most of my models have either no or
          limited experience modeling, especially partially clothed or in any
          state of nudity. As I have noted, I am not a professional photographer
          and I do not expect you to be a professional model. I pursue this line
          of photographic subject for a sense of artistic fulfillment.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will not be required but may choose to be either partially or
          fully nude at the beginning of the shoot. When you become partially or
          fully nude will be your decision, if you make it. If you prefer, we
          will begin with you partially clothed to your comfort level and then
          move on to camera views from your back and sides with less clothing.
          You can indicate when you are ready to progress to the next stage of
          both camera view and undress.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will only use final images on my website in which you are not likely
          to be identified by face, hairstyle (if distinctive), tattoos or
          piercings (unless waived) by your friends and family, unless you
          specifically approve an image. I do not intend to promote my web site
          on the internet or for commercial purposes. Any of your friends and
          family who may visit my website will be referred by you because you
          are pleased with the images in which you appear. If I should feel
          strongly that a final image in which you can be identified has
          significant merit, I will use it only after your approval and release
          of that specific image. No images, non-identifiable or identifiable
          (even with your approval) will ever be used on any social media.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most women are critical of their own physical appearance, and it is
          probable that you to believe you are not “photogenic” in some respect.
          It is safe to say that you (and, everyone, female and male) have
          physical features you would like to change – even in photos in which
          you are fully clothed. This may especially come into play when you
          view my photos of you. In fact, you may prefer to not view your
          photographs at all. You may prefer to select a photo (included in your
          compensation) from one of my other projects on my website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do not hesitate to fully discuss with me your concerns and you may
          pause or terminate the shoot at any time. If you feel uncomfortable at
          any time, please tell me immediately so that we can make appropriate
          adjustments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you for considering modeling for me. If you should decide
          against it the first time around, I will understand and remain
          interested in the event you change your mind.

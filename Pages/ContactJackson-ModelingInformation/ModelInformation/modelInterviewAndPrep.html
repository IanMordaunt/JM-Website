              During our initial interview, we will establish our mutual expectations.  
              I will also gather your contact information, emergency contact information 
              and information about your physical limitations, if any, 
              food and insect allergies and picnic food preferences.  
              We will agree on hourly or daily fees for travel and for modeling time.  
              We will agree on place and time, subject to weather, and the clothing 
              and props you will be expected to provide, if any.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the photoshoot, you should have normal gear for a light day hike,
              including footwear, rain jacket, sunscreen (“dry touch” – non greasy)
              and hat or cap. I will have mirror, but you will want to carry a comb
              or brush. You are encouraged to carry your cell phone in case of
              emergency.
            </p>
            <p>
              You should have loose fitting cover up (which could double for travel) 
              and sandals or slipon shoes to wear while walking about the site 
              between photos.  Your hair should be freshly washed and normally styled, 
              makeup should be “everyday”, legs and underarms shaved; and, pubic hair, 
              if usually trimmed, shaved or waxed, should be recently treated.  
            </p>
            <p class="dayHikeTitle">
              DAY HIKING AND RELATED TRAVEL POSE RISKS TO PERSONAL SAFETY:
            </p>
            <p>
              You will be asked 
              to acknowledge and to confirm that you understand that day hiking and related 
              travel may result in travel and hiking and related injuries, such as scratches/cuts, 
              sprains, breaks, falls, bruising, insect bites, snake bite and other injuries.  
              You will be asked to agree that you are entirely responsible for your own personal 
              safety and to understand you may decline any suggested trail or any suggested 
              spot for photos.  You will be asked to confirm that you understand that you 
              may express concern for your personal safety at any time.  You will be asked 
              to agree that I have no responsibility or liability to you for any injuries 
              you may sustain in travel to and from and in the course of the Photo Shoot 
              and no liability for any costs for medical treatment:  and, you will be asked 
              to generally and specifically release me from responsibility and liability 
            </p>
            <p>
              You will be asked to sign a general <a href="../ModelInformation/ModelRelease.html">Model Release</a> at the end of the
              photoshoot. The general Model Release does not cover images in which you are readily 
              identifiable by friends and family.  If I should wish to use any such images on my website, 
              I will ask you for an addendum to the Model Release to cover specific images after you 
              have had an opportunity to review the images.  You may decline to release any images 
              in which you are readily identifiable by friends and family.  No images will ever be 
              used on any social media.

         For valuable consideration received at the conclusion of the photo shoot covered by this Model Release, as recorded on the reverse hereof, I, the model signing below, grant to Jackson L.

I waive any and all right to review or approve any individual photographs and images in which I am not identifiable by face, distinctive hairstyle, tattoos or piercings by friends and family, but nevertheless reserve my full right to review and approve prior to any use of specific photographs or images in which (a) I am fully nude, partially nude or my nudity can be ascertained and (b) I am also identifiable by friends and family, as set forth in, subject to and added to this Model Release by the Addendum attached hereto.  I release and discharge the Photographer from any and all claims and demands that may arise out of or in connection with the use of the photographs and images, including without limitation any and all claims for libel or violation of any right of publicity or privacy.  I am a legally competent adult and have the right to contract in my own name.  I have read this Model Release, the Addendum and the incorporated Photo Shoot Plan and fully understand their contents.  This Model Release shall be binding upon me and my heirs, legal representatives, and assigns.

              Your decision to model partially clothed, partially nude or fully 
              nude for the first time is an important one.  Even your consideration 
              of modeling or commitment to model partially clothed or in any state 
              of nudity can present an emotional hurdle.  The experience of modeling 
              partial clothed or in any state of nudity for the first time may put 
              you outside your comfort zone and may be emotionally challenging.  
              Although you may experience anxiety and feelings of vulnerable, you 
              can be assured you will be in a perfectly safe environment.  At 
              some point early in the photo shoot, you may expect to forget about 
              your lack of clothing and begin to get involved in how your pose will 
              fit into the natural landscape features – the trees and rocks.  
              As noted in my interview presentation, my objective is for you to 
              have an enjoyable experience, one I hope you will be eager to repeat.
            </p>
            <p>
              I prefer to use amateur models because they do not have a repertoire 
              of stock poses.  This is the reason I have approached you about 
              modeling.  As a consequence, most of my models have either no or 
              limited experience modeling, especially partially clothed or in 
              any state of nudity.  As I have noted, I am not a professional 
              photographer and I do not expect you to be a professional model.  
              I pursue this line of photographic subject for a sense of artistic fulfillment.
            </p>
            <p>
              You will not be required to be either partially or fully nude at the beginning 
              of the shoot.  When you become partially or fully nude is your decision.  
            </p>
            <p>
              I will only use final images on my web site in which you cannot be 
              readily identified by face, hairstyle (if distinctive) or tattoos 
              by your friends and family.  I do not intend to promote my web site 
              on the internet or for commercial purposes.  Any of your friends 
              and family who may visit my website will be referred by you because 
              you are pleased with the images in which you appear.  If I should 
              feel strongly that a final image in which you can be identified has 
              significant merit, I will use it only after your approval and 
              release of that specific image.  No images, non-identifiable or 
              identifiable (even with your approval) will ever be used on any 
              social media.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most women are critical of their own physical appearance, and it 
              is probable that you believe you are not “photogenic” in some respect.  
              It is safe to say that you (and, everyone, female and male) have 
              physical features you would like to change – even in photos in 
              which you are fully clothed.  This may especially come into play 
              when you view my photos of you.  In fact, you may prefer to not 
              view your photographs at all.  You may prefer to select a photo 
              (included in your compensation) from one of my other projects, 
              which you can view at jacksonLmorrisphotography.com.
            </p>
            <p>
              Do not hesitate to fully discuss with me your concerns. 
              You may terminate the shoot at any time.  If you feel uncomfortable 
              at any time, please tell me immediately so that we can make 
              appropriate adjustments.
            </p>

              Thank you for considering modeling for me.  
              If you should decide against it the first time around, 
              I will understand and remain interested in the event you 
              change your mind.

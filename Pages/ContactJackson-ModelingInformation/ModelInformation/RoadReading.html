        <h2>READING FOR THE ROAD</h2>
        <h2>DESIRED PHOTOSHOOT OUTCOMES AND PROCESS</h2>
        <h4>FIGURES WITH TREES & ROCKS</h4>
        <p>Photos by Jackson Morris</p>
        <hr />
      </div>
      <div class="notesContent">
        <ul>
            <li>Even though you are reading this on my website, I will have a printed copy for you to review during our drive to the photoshoot location.</li>
            <li>The desired outcome of our photoshoot is for me to achieve a number of images suitable to be called “fine art”.</li>
            <li>My desired outcome of our photoshoot is for you to enjoy a favorable and personally satisfying experience that you would like to repeat.</li>
            <li>Our effort to achieve these outcomes will involve a high degree of cooperation and collaboration between us.</li>
            <li>Our photoshoot will involve two themes:  (a) Figures with Trees and Rocks; and (b) My Favorite Cereal.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In both, the objective is to show you, your parts, shapes and textures related to or contrasted with the geologic formations, rocks and trees at the location site.  The inclusion of a box of your favorite cereal from time to time adds an unexpected twist to the resulting photos.
        </p>
        <p>
            As we spend time at the location, I expect you to participate in identifying features – geologic formations, rocks and trees – to which you relate and “poses” you believe may achieve our objectives.
        </p>
        <p>
            We need you to avoid contact with stinging insects and rattle snakes – watch where you step and place your hands; each new location needs to be thoroughly inspected before posing; and, if there is any buzzing sound, you must immediately freeze until its source is identified.  I have actually encountered only two rattle snakes in twenty-five years of hiking in New Mexico, but they are out there.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Please drink plenty of fluids.  Please be aware of when you need sunscreen.</li>
            <li>You will be in direct contact with scratchy rocks and trees.  We need to minimize scratching by using “invisible” padding as much as possible.</li>
            <li> Please discuss aspects of any previous modeling experiences you did not like, which made you feel uncomfortable or were unsatisfactory.</li>
            <li> Please discuss any aspects of previous modeling experiences you found satisfying.</li>
            <li>  Please immediately express any discomfort, either physical or feeling of unacceptable vulnerability, so we can take action to eliminate it.  You may pause or stop the photoshoot at any time.  In the event I feel a need to make an adjustment to your pose that I have not been successful in communicating to you verbally or if you should need a boost up to higher rock feature, I will ask for your approval before touching you in any way after my explanation of exactly what I propose to do in the adjustment or boosting.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You may see the “replay” of any image at any time.</p>
        <p>
            We will “capture” a lot of images, some of which may include “more of you”, including face, parts and identifiable marks, such as tattoos and piercings, than you may feel comfortable with in a final image.  However, only a limited number of the images will be usable and the discomforting areas of original image capture will most likely to be cropped out of the final image.  See, A Word About Lenses, below.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every pose on location will “stay on location”, so I encourage you to be creative and expressive in any poses that you think might “work”, even though the full image may be more revealing than you are comfortable with.  See about cropping images, above.
        </p>
        <p>Remember that you must approve and specifically release any final images in which you would be identified by face, hairstyle (if distinctive), tattoos or piercings by your friends and family.  And, no images will ever be posted to social media.</p>
        <p>A Word About Lenses.  I may use a number of lenses during the shoot, but primarily lens in the 18mm to 70mm focal length range, or a wider range zoom lens set to the shorter focal lengths.  The “shorter” focal lengths will require working close to you in order to capture your figure as the center of attention, but also at a little distance to include your surroundings for “sense of place”.  The shorter focal lengths with a wider aperture achieves a narrow or shallow “depth of field” – f-1.4 is the largest aperture with lenses in this focal length range, which means only part your figure may be in focus while the foreground and back ground may be out of focus.  With the shorter focal lengths, you may have a sense of what part of you I am including in the full frame as shot – with the longer lens (working at a greater distance) it will be less clear to you what I am including within the full frame.  The frame as shot will seldom be the frame as cropped in the final image.  We can discuss more about how the camera and lenses work (to the limit of my knowledge) during the shoot, if you have an interest.</p>
        <p>If you should feel a concern or discomfort about the distance separating us or what you sense will be in the full frame image, please express any concern or discomfort immediately so that we may discuss and make agreed upon adjustments.  You may ask to see a “replay” of any image any time.</p>

            I use non-professional models who I recruit personally or who are
            recommended by friends and young women who have modeled for me. Some
            have had limited modeling experience. Most have never modeled
            before.

          person that I have worked for.‚Äù

          Model ML said, ‚ÄúI did not expect to have so much fun. And the rock
          formations were amazing. On future shoots, I look forward to seeing
          other locations in New Mexico you know about.‚Äù
        </p>
        <p>
          Model SD said, ‚Äúmy photo shoot was such a fun adventure. You were
          incredibly professional throughout the entirety of the project. And,
          you offered the perfect balance between specific instruction and
          improvisation. I enjoyed the healthy picnic lunch and I got to see
          part of New Mexico that otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt have explored. I look
          forward to future projects we will collaborate on and will highly
          recommend you to my friends as someone to work with!‚Äù Post Script:
          ‚ÄúYour photos look beautiful.‚Äù

          Model AM said, after hollyhock shoot, ‚ÄúI can honestly say, I think
          I‚Äôll never look at a hollyhock the same again. I very much appreciate
          all the time you‚Äôve spent revising, polishing and perfecting the pics.
          You‚Äôre really a gifted and imaginative photographer. I think the
          images look amazingly dreamy and ethereal.‚Äù
        </p>
        <p>
          Model AM said, after outdoor shoot, ‚ÄúI had a great deal of
          apprehension about posing nude. Somehow, you managed to push me out of
          my comfort zone by explaining your creative vision. And you were
          open to collaboration and listening to my ideas ‚Äì you made me feel
          comfortable and free by creating an environment of trust and respect.
          You have such a warm spirit and are easy to get along with. Your
          encouragement and positivity kept me motivated!‚Äù

        <p>
          Model SP said, ‚ÄúI had a great experience working with you. You made me
          feel very comfortable and were extremely open and receptive to
          collaboration and feedback. The photographs turned out beautifully and
          I am looking forward to working with you again.‚Äù Later, she added
          ‚ÄúLooking through to select these photos I want prints of, I was
          stunned again by the work you did. It was real tricky to choose!‚Äù
        </p>
        <p>
          Model CE said, ‚ÄúAs you know, I took a friend along for moral support
          for our first two shoots. You made us both feel so comfortable it was
          amazing. And, the third shoot with only the two of us was no
          different. I think I look great in ‚Äúour‚Äù photos. I really enjoy our
          professional relationship ‚Äì and the picnic lunches.‚Äù
        </p>
        <p>
          Model AS said, ‚ÄúJackson is kind, honest, and down to earth, and was 
          very conscientious of my safety. I felt very comfortable and had a 
          wonderful time shooting with him. I would definitely work with him again.‚Äù

          SLR (believe it or not) said, ‚ÄúI just looked at your website. Whoa! I
          think your most successful images clearly are of people. Next time we
